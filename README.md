# Purpose of Project
The purpose of our project is to determine the number of retiring employees by title and identify which employees are eligible to to participate in the mentorship program. Our retiring employees by title information will show the titles of all employees born between January, 1 1952 and December, 31 1955.

1. Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
2. Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
3. Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis

# Results

- With the retirment_titles table we are able to see every eligible for retirement employee and how long they have worked at each position over the course of their career.

- The unique titles table that we created is showing the most recent title for employees of retirment age.

- Our retiring_titles shows us the a majority of the employees of retirment age (57,668/90,398 = 64%) have senior titles.
